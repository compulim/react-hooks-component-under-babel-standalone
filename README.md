This is a sandbox for trying out a minimal setup for the following:

- Build a UI library that use React Hooks
- Consume the library in a few ways:
   - Full Babel (consume UI library as NPM package)
   - Babel Standalone (consume UI library as CDN bundle, with JSX)
   - Pure JavaScript (consume UI library as CDN bundle, without JSX)
- Developers can specify the version of React they want to use, UI library must obey
